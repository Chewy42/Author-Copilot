# Completely Automated E-Commerce
## By Matt Favela B.S. Data Science, Chapman University - Self-Lead Research Project

# Project Scope
### Project Vision
* The vision for this project is to combine all of the new artificial intelligence technologies and Python automation tools to completely automate a professional-looking e-commerce store
## Project Description
### Problem
* The problem that I would like to solve is to fix the struggles of putting in hundreds of hours into building an e-commerce business and then having it flop or not knowing what to do.
### Target Audience
* Me
* Entrepreneurs
* AI Nerds (Also me)
### Needs
"This is needed for the target audience..."
* (myself) because I want to automate ACTUAL passive income with little-to-no financial investment
* (entrepreneurs) because the e-commerce era is booming and they need to rapidly build and manage online stores
* (ai nerds) because they need to see the actual posibilities of artificial intelligence.
## Goals and My Approach
### Goals
* Goal 1: Automate store setup with shopify using selenium or api's and gpt-3
* Goal 2: Automate finding niche-related products (niches given by gpt-3)
* Goal 3: Automate creating marketing ads and posting to tiktok on a fresh account
### My Approach
* To automate the store setup, I will have to webscrape the shopify website to setup the store and use gpt-3 responses to customize it
* To automate finding a niche-related product I will webscrape websites with popular niche products automatically, then find it on aliexpress
*  To automate the marketing I will use ai tools such as Synthesia.io and gpt-3 for advertisements
## Project Acceptance Criteria
* The creation of the website through shopify and/or accounts associated with it are completely automated.
* Filling the store with products catered to the specfic niche of the website has to be completely automated
* All marketing materials must be generated and ran through a newely generated tiktok account for that website
